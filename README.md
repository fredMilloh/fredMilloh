# iOS training projects

---

> June, 2022 *Diploma*
Validation by the jury of the Application Developer - iOS Diploma

> May, 2022 *ProductRecall* project
Mission: The project closing the iOS training is free and allows to mobilize the acquired skills.

Action: Autonomous I learned and applied two new frameworks out of the course, SwiftUI and Combine. (autonomy skill to learn)

Result: The MVP application allows for immediate or future sharing of non-compliant consumer product recalls from the API of the interministerial governmental website *RappelConso*.
    The code is versioned with Sourcetree, and uses CoreData for persistence.

Feb 28, 2022 *WhatDoWeEat* project
>#### Mission: For this project, a [specification](https://github.com/fredMilloh/WhatDoWeEat/files/9337498/Reciplease%2B-%2BCahier%2Bdes%2Bcharges%2B-%2BDA%2BiOS.pdf) is provided to create an application using the Alamofire library for network calls. Depending on the ingredients entered, the application displays a list of recipes.

>#### Action: I created an MVVM architecture, and developed the viewModels in TDD. For the open source third party library, I used CocoaPods. Data passing is done with delegate patterns. The relevance is managed with Core Data.

>#### Result: Only letters and commas are allowed for the input of ingredients. The application allows to save favorite recipes, managing a Table View with PrefetchDataSource for pagination, and displays alerts in case of input errors.

>#### Creation of an application to obtain recipes based on the inventory of one's fridge. Saving recipes in favourites.
