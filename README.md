> Mar 9, 2022 **Technological watch** project

*mission*: Building a technology watch

*Action*: Selection of relevant information sources.

*Result*: Setting up a monitoring dashboard.

---


> Feb 28, 2022 **WhatDoWeEat** project

*Mission*: For this project, a [specification](https://github.com/fredMilloh/WhatDoWeEat/files/9337498/Reciplease%2B-%2BCahier%2Bdes%2Bcharges%2B-%2BDA%2BiOS.pdf) is provided to create an application using the Alamofire library for network calls. Depending on the ingredients entered, the application displays a list of recipes.

*Action*: I created an MVVM architecture, and developed the viewModels in TDD. For the open source third party library, I used CocoaPods. Data passing is done with delegate patterns. The relevance is managed with Core Data.

*Result*: Only letters and commas are allowed for the input of ingredients. The application allows to save favorite recipes, managing a Table View with PrefetchDataSource for pagination, and displays alerts in case of input errors.
